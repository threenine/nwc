          Professional Counsellor</h4>
        <div class="relative mt-5 p-5">
          <p class="text-3xl font-medium text-yellow-500 ">Are you searching for another way to manage what is going on for you in your life?</p>
          <p class="text-lg mx-2 font-medium mt-5">
            You are vital, and, I respect your journey for whatever has brought you to my page.Â  Seeking counselling can seem daunting, and it will be something that you might be considering. Exploring other people outside of your family and frienship circle that you do not want o burden or wish to understand what is going on for you, either currently and perhaps in the past. Talking to someone who is neutral and can be a way of releasing some of the confusion and inner tension that has felt like anxiety and frustration. A therapeutic relationship is unique, it is where you can say things that perhaps you have never shared before, and it is within this relationship that you can start to look further into your world.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mt-5 mx-2 font-medium">
            I offer you confidentiality, trust and acceptance to listen to your inner most thoughts and feelings, at your pace, where you feel you need to look further at and together you can, your growth and striving to be more accepting of yourself and believing in your own autonomy. Taking what you bring at your pace I will walk beside you to unravel the journey that has brought you to this point. I offer you unconditional positive regard to your uniqueness as a human being.</p>

          <p class="text-lg mt-5 mx-2 font-medium">I will encourage you to develop confidence in your ability to rely on your ability to rely on your own instincts for what lays ahead.</p>
