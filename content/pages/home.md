# Welcome

I am a fully qualified counsellor working in the Swindon area, offering counselling to adults and young people 
from age 16 upwards, covering a wide range  of issues.

### About counselling

Counselling can support you to help yourself in a safe and confidential environment, offering you an opportunity to 
feel less isolated in your situation. To talk and be truly heard by someone who is outside of your usual social circle, 
to share your thoughts and feelings which you cannot share elsewhere in your life.

Having the confidential space to talk can help some people find a way forward. Counselling isnâ€™t about giving advice, 
it is about being aware of the choices you have and which ones feel right for you to make. 

### Why counselling 
Sometimes it is easy to feel that you are expected to be able to cope with everything that is going on.

* You might be struggling to understand your own feelings and what is going on for you at this moment. 
* You may be experiencing distress, anxiety and emotion about a situation or trying to manage a crisis or life-changing 
event. 
* It may be that you feel lost, have low self-esteem or depressed and are struggling to understand how or why you feel 
this way.
* You might feel emotional and uncertain about a situation, person or relationship.
* You may think that your emotional well-being is not what it ought to be or have something on your mind.

Talking about these situations can feel daunting, however reaching out to talk could be what it takes to stop 
suppressing these concerns, which can help your well-being.

How can we work together
My approach to counselling is a person-centred one. I feel the relationship between client and counsellor is 
fundamental in helping to provide the supportive environment where you can have the opportunity to gain a better 
understanding of yourself and the challenges you are facing. Here you will be able to explore what is concerning you, 
without judgement, keeping at your pace where I will truly hear you as you present your thoughts and feelings. I am 
led by you the client, and believe that given the right environment you hold the answers to your own freedom and growth. 
I will listen and we can explore what is going on for you and reflect back the impact this has had on you.

Your journey to seek counselling is as unique as you are which is my fundamental belief within the person-centred 
modality that I work.
